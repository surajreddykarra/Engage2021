# ClassIt
## A classroom utility app I built for Microsoft Engage 2021 Program

* As a part of the Engage 2021 FTE program, we were asked to build a tool that will help students uphold their academic activities and make university community stronger.

* The open-ended problem statement made me more interested in adding many innovative and some first-time features for a classroom app.

* I planned my project timeline with 4 sprints with varying durations.
* The first 4 days were spent in designing the app work-flow and other backend requirements.
* During the next sprint which spanned for a week, I learnt some new technologies which had to be incorporated into the app. By the end of sprint-2, I made a small working prototype of the app with basic-features.
* Next 8-10 days were spent in continuously adding multiple features to the app.
